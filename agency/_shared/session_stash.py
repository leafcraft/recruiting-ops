"""Per-session scratch state for recruiting-ops bounded back-edges.

Used for cycles that MUST terminate (Rule 3 — bound every retry
back-edge), counted across a req/candidate's life:

  * resume-screener re-source rounds (thin-pipeline loop)
  * interview-loop redesign rounds (recruiter ⇄ coordinator)

In-process dict keyed by session_id. Single-replica dev default. For a
multi-replica deployment, swap the primitives below for Redis hashes
(the SDK's Redis client is available on the mesh instance).
